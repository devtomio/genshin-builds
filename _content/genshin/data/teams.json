He is particularly effective in situations where elemental reactions are not readily available. In this case, the Swirl Team composition is a popular choice, as it allows Venti to apply both pyro and hydro damage to enemies.\n\nAside from the Swirl Team, Venti's best team can also be formed using the Elemental RES team. This team composition is particularly effective in situations where enemies have high resistance to a single element. By combining the elemental shields provided by Venti, Xiao, and Mona, the team can provide a high level of protection and damage output.\n\nFor those looking to optimize their Venti team further"},"kaedehara_kazuha":{"teams":[{"name":"Kazuha Catalyze Team","tier":"S","description":"A team that utilizes Kazuha's support abilities to enhance the Electro DMG of Nahida through catalyzing.
